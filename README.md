# B4TM_group3

The repo for group 3 for the course Bioinformatics for Translational Medicine.

Quick git intro, create your own branch that you work on locally in order not to clash with other's code, you first commit your changes and then you push them into the branch. You only push into master when the code works the way you want it to and does not give any errors, that way we are all working error free. You can either work in the Git GUI or on an IDE of your choice (Intelij, Pycharm, hell even notepad++ works). There are a lot of tutorials online but feel free to ask me if you dont understand it!! For now I have put the code Timo wrote in the branch transform_data It seems like it has a bit of a problem with the array as it is not yet 2d.
